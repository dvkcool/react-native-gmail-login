# Gmail Sign in for react-native application
This is a basic application which allows user to login with their gmail-id and just display their name in an alert box.

## Pre-requisites
1. Node
2. Yarn package manager
3. XCode with CLI tools

## Deployment instruction
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dvkcool/react-native-gmail-login.git
$ cd react-native-gmail-login
$ yarn install
$ react-native run-ios
```
The last command may be replaced as with run-android to run on android.
However at present it is tested only on iOS.
